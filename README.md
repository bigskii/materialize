# Materialize
Materials → Armor → Materials  
Skript that "decrafts" gear into their raw materials.  
Current working gear:
* Diamond armor  
* Gold armor  
* Iron armor   
* Leather armor
Includes durability (if you had 5/8 durability left on a chestplate, you would get 5 items)  
Works with the /mat command which requires skript.mat permission to use.  
Requires [Skript](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript).
